##Note-taking:

### Semantic UI

- Grid has 16 cols, unlike Bootstrap with 12 cols

### Typescript

- Flow or Typescript for React?

### React

###### Break down the UI into components first

###### Idetify state

###### Controlled vs Uncontrolled, when to use which ?

###### Using `key` instead of `componentWillReceiveProps`

- Component updates when either props or state changes

### React Router

- Link vs NavLink
- history props, when it is available?
  > Case 1: <Route path="" component={X} />
  > Case 2: Not inside Route, need withRouter
- Internal Routing: Redirect and Route inside Switch
